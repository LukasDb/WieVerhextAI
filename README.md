# Wie verhext AI
Implementation of the game 'Wie verhext'
## Game Explanation
### Basic Game rules
One game consists of an unknown number of rounds.
In each round, players choose 5 cards from their deck (Phase I).
In one turn, the starting player plays a card from his hand. Then the other players are asked (clockwise) if they also had chosen the same card in phase I. If they did, they must play this card, but they can choose, to use the top or bottom action on the card. Only the last player that chose the top action gets to execute it. If a player chose the bottom action, they execute the action immediately.
The player who got to play the top action, is the starting player for the next turn. When a player runs out of cards, the next player becomes the starting player. If all players are out of cards, the game continues with the next round, starting with Phase I again.
The game ends when the 4th raven (specially marked potions) has been drawn by any player, the game then continues until all players are out of cards and the points are counted.
